# TerminalSnake
The Snake Game to be played in the Linux terminal.
##### This game is not finished yet! There's still a bug that needs to be fixed :/ Nevertheless, it is my first coded game ever and it was my first college project.
##### The entry it expects includes the executable archive and the path to the directory where the game map is.

#####  For example:
#### ./compiled.exe Casos/Testes/simples/3

##### When you complete the game, either dying or winning, it generates a series of archives with information from the match, such as a heatmap, a summary of the movements you made and stats;
### I hope you enjoy your match! Good luck :)
